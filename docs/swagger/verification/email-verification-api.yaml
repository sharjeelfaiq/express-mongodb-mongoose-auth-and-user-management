    RESTful API for email verification and notification operations supporting user account activation.

    ## Overview
    This API provides endpoints for email verification during user registration and account activation processes.

    ## Key Features
    - JWT-based email verification tokens
    - Automatic user cleanup on verification failures
    - HTML email templates for verification
    - Verification notification pages

    ## Security Model
    - No authentication required (part of account activation flow)
    - Time-limited JWT tokens with user identification
    - Single-use verification tokens

    ## Integration Points
    - User Management API for user data operations
    - Nodemailer for email delivery
    - JWT for token generation and validation

        - Email Verification
      summary: Verify email address with token
      description: |
        Validates the email verification token and activates the user account.

        ## Process Flow
        1. Decodes and validates the JWT verification token
        2. Extracts `userId` from token payload
        3. Updates user's `isEmailVerified` status to `true`
        4. Returns HTML verification success page

        ## Token Requirements
        - Valid JWT format signed with system secret
        - Contains `userId` field with valid MongoDB ObjectId
        - Must not be expired

        ## Response Format
        Returns HTML content (not JSON) for browser display with login redirect link.

        - Email Verification
      summary: Send verification email
      description: |
        Sends a verification email containing a secure JWT token to the specified email address.

        ## Process Flow
        1. Validates that a user exists with the provided email
        2. Generates JWT verification token containing user ID
        3. Sends HTML verification email via Nodemailer
        4. Returns JSON success response

        ## Error Handling
        If token generation or email sending fails, the user account is automatically 
        deleted to prevent orphaned unverified accounts.

        ## Email Template
        Uses HTML template from `views/verification-email/index.html` with dynamic 
        token and backend URL substitution.
